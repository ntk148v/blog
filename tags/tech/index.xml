      <description>Disclaimer: I love customizing desktop. I make changes in my desktop everyday, make it look eye candy. My colleagues ask me how to make their desktop look like mine. But there are many steps and things to learn and follow, I know because I&amp;rsquo;ve gone throught it. Therefore I decide to write this getting-started guide to give people a shortest path to Fancy world.
 1. Overview Window Manager #  First of all, you have to know the basic concepts.</description>

      <description>1. What is Swap? #  Swap file systems support virtual memory, data is written to a swap file system when there is not enough RAM to store the data your system is processing.
2. Swap partition size #  2.1. Old rule of thumb #  swap = 2 * the-amount-of-RAM So if a computer had 64KB of RAM, a swap partition of 128KB would be an optimum size. This rule took into the facts that RAM sizes were typically quite small at the time.</description>

 Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring &amp;amp; alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud.
1.1. Features #   a multi-dimensional data model with time series data identified by metric name &amp;amp; key/value pairs PromQL, a flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality no reliance on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous time series collection happens via a pull model over HTTP pushing time series is supported via an intermediary gateway targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration multiple modes of graphing &amp;amp; dashboarding support  1.</description>

      <description>NOTE: This is my perspective aggregation. You can easily find these such of knowledges in the references.
 1. Context #  Etcd Version v3.4.0.
2. Requirements #  2.1. Number of nodes #   &amp;gt;= 3 nodes. A etcd cluster needs a majority of nodes, a quorum to agree on updates to the cluster state. For a cluster with n-members, quorum is (n/2)+1.  2.2. CPUs #   Etcd doesn&amp;rsquo;t require a lot of CPU capacity.</description>

      <description>NOTE(kiennt): There is a legacy Faythe guideline. The new version is coming soon, check its repository for status.
 This guide describes how to automatically scale out your Compute instances in response to heavy system usage. By combining with Prometheus pre-defined rules that consider factors such as CPU or memory usage, you can configure OpenStack Orchestration (Heat) to add and remove additional instances automatically, when they are needed.
1. The standard OpenStack Autoscaling approach #  Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the standard OpenStack Autoscaling approach before goes to the new approach.</description>

      <description>Hugo ships with support for Disqus, a third-party service that provides comment and community capabilities to websites via JavaScript. But Disqus generates a shit load of page requests and heavy contents&amp;hellip; which even with the benefits that come with having Disqus in place. People just want something that can be used to post a comment, that is.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I choose a Disqus alternative - Utterances. Utterances is a lightweight comments widget built on Github issues.</description>
