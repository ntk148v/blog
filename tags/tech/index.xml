What is Swap? # Swap file systems support virtual memory, data is written to a swap file system when there is not enough RAM to store the data your system is processing.
2. Swap partition size # 2.1. Old rule of thumb # swap = 2 * the-amount-of-RAM So if a computer had 64KB of RAM, a swap partition of 128KB would be an optimum size. This rule took into the facts that RAM sizes were typically quite small at the time.</description></item><item><title>Ansitheus</title><link>https://ntk148v.github.io/blog/posts/ansitheus/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2020 13:51:59 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://ntk148v.github.io/blog/posts/ansitheus/</guid><description>1 Ansitheus = Ansible + Prometheus 1.

2. Requirements # 2.1. Number of nodes # &amp;gt;= 3 nodes. A etcd cluster needs a majority of nodes, a quorum to agree on updates to the cluster state. For a cluster with n-members, quorum is (n/2)+1. 2.2.

The new version is coming soon, check its repository for status.
This guide describes how to automatically scale out your Compute instances in response to heavy system usage. By combining with Prometheus pre-defined rules that consider factors such as CPU or memory usage, you can configure OpenStack Orchestration (Heat) to add and remove additional instances automatically, when they are needed.

The standard OpenStack Autoscaling approach # Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the standard OpenStack Autoscaling approach before goes to the new approach.</description></item><item><title>Lets Comment</title><link>https://ntk148v.github.io/blog/posts/lets-comment/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Oct 2018 09:47:11 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://ntk148v.github.io/blog/posts/lets-comment/</guid><description>Hugo ships with support for Disqus, a third-party service that provides comment and community capabilities to websites via JavaScript. But Disqus generates a shit load of page requests and heavy contents&amp;hellip; which even with the benefits that come with having Disqus in place. People just want something that can be used to post a comment, that is.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I choose a Disqus alternative - Utterances. Utterances is a lightweight comments widget built on Github issues.</description></item></channel></rss>
