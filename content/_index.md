**This theme is archived in order to move to new [site](https://ntk148v.github.io)!**

**Q**: Why change?

**A**: I've created a [complete new Hugo theme](https://github.com/ntk148v/hugo-toigian), and I'am very excited about it. Just want to know how it look in reality.

**Q**: Why you don't just change your theme in this repository?

**A**: This [repository](https://github.com/ntk148v/blog) is too large now, many many commits and files. I just want to a fresh start.
