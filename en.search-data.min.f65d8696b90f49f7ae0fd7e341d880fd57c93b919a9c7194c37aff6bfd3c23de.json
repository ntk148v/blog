I make changes in my desktop everyday, make it look eye candy. My colleagues ask me how to make their desktop look like mine. But there are many steps and things to learn and follow, I know because I\u0026rsquo;ve gone throught it. Therefore I decide to write this getting-started guide to give people a shortest path to Fancy world.\n 1. Overview Window Manager #  First of all, you have to know the basic concepts.\n1.1. Desktop Environment vs. Window Manager #  We\u0026rsquo;ll begin by showing how the Linux graphical desktop is layered. There are basically 3 layers that can be included in the Linux desktop:\n X Window: All GUIs require an X Window System layer, which draws graphic elements on the display. Without the X server, neither a WM nor a DE could create images on a Linux display. X also creates a framework for moving windows and performing tasks using a mouse and keyboard. Window manager:  A WM controls the placement and appearance of screen elements. Popular WMs: i3, awesome, dwm\u0026hellip; Requires configuration to get what you want. Tends to be flexible and highly customizable. Customizes most aspects of a Linux experience. For Nerd: not user-friendly out of the box, need to edit configuration files\u0026hellip;   Desktop environment:  A DE requires both X and a WM. It also adds the deeper and seemless integration with applications, panels, system menus, status applets, drag-and-drop functionality,\u0026hellip; The most popular DEs: KDE Plasma, GNOME, Pantheon, Cinnamon,\u0026hellip; Sounds familiar, right? Excellent default configurations. May not be particularly customizable. Gret if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to customize everything.     mermaid.initialize({ \"flowchart\": { \"useMaxWidth\":true }, \"theme\": \"default\" } ) graph TD; A[Desktop Environment] -- B[Window Manager]; B -- C[X Windows]; 1.2. Types of Window Manager #   Stack window manager:  A stack window manager renders the window one-by-one onto the screen at specific co-orinates. If one window\u0026rsquo;s area overlaps another, then the window \u0026ldquo;on top\u0026rdquo; overwites part of the other\u0026rsquo;s visible appearance. This results in the appearance familiar to many users in which windows act a little like pieces of paper on a desktop, which can be moved around and allowed to overlap. Openbox, Fluxbox, Enlightenment\u0026hellip;   Tiling window manager:  A window manager with an organization of the screen into mutually non-overlapping frames (hence the name tiling), as opposed to the traditional approach of coordinate-based stacking of objects (windows) that tries to emulate the desk paradigm. Awesome,i3 (here we go), dwm, bspwm\u0026hellip;   Compositing window manager:  A compositing window manager may appear to the user similar to a stacking window manager. However, the individual windows are first renders in individual buffers, and then theirs images are composited onto the screen buffer; this two-step process means that visual effects (such as shadows, translucency) can be applied. Mutter (GNOME), Xfwm (XFCE), Compiz (Unity), KWin (KDE)    2. Overview I3 #   i3wm is a tiling window manager designed for X11. It supports tiling, stacking, and tabbing layouts, which it handles dynamically. Configuration is achieved via plain text file. Keyboard navigation: Hall full control with keyboard navigation. Minimalistic: no window decorations or nonsense icons floating around. But you can fully customize it. Window management: is left to the user. Windows are held inside containers, which can be split veritically or horizontally. They can also optionally be resized. There are also options for stacking the windows, as well as tabbing them. Floating pop-up windows. Want more, check this.  3. Minimal Ubuntu I3 setup #  3.1. Ubuntu Server #   Download the installer and install Ubuntu server by walking through installer. If you\u0026rsquo;re completely new to it, you can follow official documentation. The version 20.04.2.  3.2. Desktop #   We\u0026rsquo;ll need a display server so let\u0026rsquo;s install X Window System (Xorg)  sudo apt install xinit # The configuration files are stored in /etc/X11/xinit # You can override it by creating and modifying ~/.xinitrc 3.3. Tiling Window Manager - I3 #   You can install i3 from Ubuntu repository.  sudo apt install i3  Or build from source, I have a personal fork - Rounded i3-gaps.  # Dependencies sudo apt install git libxcb1-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev libpango1.0-dev \\  libxcb-util0-dev libxcb-icccm4-dev libyajl-dev \\  libstartup-notification0-dev libxcb-randr0-dev \\  libev-dev libxcb-cursor-dev libxcb-xinerama0-dev \\  libxcb-xkb-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev \\  autoconf libxcb-xrm0 libxcb-xrm-dev automake i3status \\  ninja-build meson libxcb-shape0-dev build-essential -y git clone https://github.com/ntk148v/i3.git cd i3/ # Compile mkdir -p build \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd build meson .. ninja sudo ninja install   Reboot. After reboot, choose i3 as your WM/DE.\n  A prompt will be shown to create a config file, just hit \u0026lt;Enter\u0026gt;.\n       \u0026lt;mod\u0026gt; key is Window now. Hit \u0026lt;mod\u0026gt;+Enter to start terminal emulator.  3.4. Configure I3 #   We have i3 first setup here with the default configuration.

This part will show you how to start with rofi.  1. Introduction #   Rofi is a window switcher, application launcher and dmenu replacement. Features:  Fully configurable keyboard navigation. Type to filer. Built-in modes:  Window switcher mode. Application laucher. Desktop file application launcher. SSH laucher mode.   History-based ordering. \u0026hellip;    2. Getting started #   Installing rofi is quite easy.  sudo apt install rofi -y  Run it for the first time.  rofi -lines 12 -padding 18 -width 60 -location 0 -show drun -sidebar-mode -columns 3 -font \u0026#39;DejaVu Sans 8\u0026#39;   Expand ↕  -show mode Open rofi in a certain mode. Available modes are window, run, drun, ssh, combi. The special argument keys can be used to open a searchable list of supported key bind‐ ings (see KEY BINDINGS) To show the run-dialog: rofi -show run -lines Maximum number of lines to show before scrolling. rofi -lines 25 Default: 15 -location Specify where the window should be located. The numbers map to the following loca‐ tions on screen: 1 2 3 8 0 4 7 6 5 Default: 0 -padding Define the inner margin of the window. Default: 5 -sidebar-mode Open in sidebar-mode. In this mode a list of all enabled modes is shown at the bot‐ tom. (See -modi option) To show sidebar, use: rofi -show run -sidebar-mode -lines 0              Press hot key (defined in i3 configuration file) \u0026lt;Window\u0026gt;+d to start rofi. Use \u0026lt;Shift\u0026gt;+\u0026lt;left/right\u0026gt; to switch between mode. More details you can found in rofi github.  3. Tweaking #   The default setup looks quite boring. Let\u0026rsquo;s tweak a bit! There are currently three methods of setting configuration options:  Local configuration. Normally, depending on XDG, in ~/.config/rofi/config. This uses the Xresources format. Xresources: A method of storing key values in the Xserver. See here for more information. Command line options: Arguments are passed to Rofi.   We will use configuration file.  mkdir -p ~/.config/rofi/themes touch ~/.config/rofi/themes/onedark.theme  Copy the follow content into ~/.config/rofi/themes/onedark.theme:  configuration { show-icons: true; font: \u0026quot;DejaVu Sans Mono 10\u0026quot;; modi: \u0026quot;window,run,drun\u0026quot;; } * { background: #282c34; foreground: #abb2bf; background-color: @background; selected-normal-foreground: @foreground; selected-normal-background: #98c379; selected-urgent-background: #e5c07b; selected-urgent-foreground: @foreground; border: 5; lines: 12; padding: 0; margin: 0; spacing: 0; } window { width: 50%; transparency: \u0026quot;real\u0026quot;; } mainbox { children: [inputbar, listview]; } listview { columns: 1; } element { padding: 12; orientation: vertical; text-color: @foreground; } element selected { background-color: @selected-normal-background; text-color: @background; } inputbar { background-color: @background; children: [prompt, entry]; } prompt { enabled: true; font: \u0026quot;DejaVu Sans Mono 10\u0026quot;; padding: 12 0 0 12; text-color: @selected-urgent-background; } entry { padding: 12; text-color: @selected-urgent-background; }  Run it and you can see the magic!  rofi -theme ~/.config/rofi/themes/onedark.theme -show drun       Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to update hotkey in i3 configuration file.  bindsym $mod+d exec rofi -theme ~/.config/rofi/themes/onedark.theme -show drun "},{"id":2,"href":"/blog/posts/getting-started-tiling-wm-part-3-polybar/","title":"Getting Started with Tiling WM [Part 3] - Polybar","section":"Posts","content":"1.

Delta aims to make this both efficient and enjoyable: it allows you to make extensive changes to the layout and styling of diffs, as well as allowing you to stay arbitrarily close to the default git/diff output. Diff/git diff doesn\u0026rsquo;t show you exactly what was changed.       Delta shows within-line highlights based on a Levenshtein edit inference algorithm.       By default, delta restructures the git output slightly to make the hunk markers human-readable:       Example config:  [core] pager = delta [delta] plus-style = \u0026#34;syntax #98c379\u0026#34; minus-style = \u0026#34;syntax #e06c75\u0026#34; syntax-theme = OneHalfDark navigate = true features = line-numbers decorations [interactive] diffFilter = delta --color-only  Completely replace diff with delta:  alias diff=\u0026#34;delta\u0026#34; 6. z #   Tired for cding into the same directories over and over? Save your time with z command! z: jump around. Z is a shell script that makes jumping around your file directory pleasantly simple. Instead of trying to remember the exact path of where you need to go, or worse, cding into the next directory followed by lsing and then cding again over and over (we’ve all been there), Z allows you to “lazy type” where you want to go and it’ll handle the rest.

What is Swap? #  Swap file systems support virtual memory, data is written to a swap file system when there is not enough RAM to store the data your system is processing.\n2. Swap partition size #  2.1. Old rule of thumb #  swap = 2 * the-amount-of-RAM So if a computer had 64KB of RAM, a swap partition of 128KB would be an optimum size. This rule took into the facts that RAM sizes were typically quite small at the time. Nowadays, RAM has become a cheap \u0026amp; affordable commondity, so the 2x rule is outdated.\n2.2. What is the right amount of swap space? #  Choosing the correct swap size is important. Too much swap space can hide memory leaks, also the storage space is allocated but idle. It can affect the system performance in general.\nFollow the RedHat (CentOS 7x \u0026amp; RHEL 7) guide, the recommended size of a swap partition depending on the amount of RAM \u0026amp; whether you want sufficient memory for your system.\nswap \u0026lt;= 10% * total-size-hard-drives \u0026amp;\u0026amp; swap \u0026lt;= 128GB (if hibernation is allowed)    Amount of RAM Recommended swap space Recommended swap space if allowing for hibernation     \u0026lt; 2GB 2 * the-amount-of-RAM 3 * the-amount-of-RAM   \u0026gt; 2GB - 8GB the-amount-of-RAM 2 * the-amount-of-RAM   \u0026gt; 8GB - 64GB \u0026gt;= 4GB 1.5 * the-amount-of-RAM   \u0026gt; 64GB \u0026gt;= 4GB Hibernation not recommended    3. Common misconceptions \u0026amp; gotchas #  3.1. Increasing swap size would increase performance #   No, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t. Remember that the slowest part of memory is your hard-disk - swap just provides the ability to use more memory by swapping some pages out to the disk, which is slow compared to RAM operations. Swap can also increase disk I/O \u0026amp; CPU load. This is a tradeoff. Without swap, the OOM may get you. It causes a downtime and in the real life scenario, the application can be slow a bit rather than down completely.  3.2. Swappiness #    The linux kernel tunable parameter vm.swappiness (/proc/sys/vm/swappiness) can be used to define how aggressively memory pages are swapped to disk.\n  The default value: 60. The lower the value, the less swapping is used \u0026amp; the more memory pages are kept in the physical memory.\n* 0: swap is disable. * 1: minimum amount of swapping without disabling it entirely. * 10: recommended value to improve performance when sufficient memory exists in a system * 100: aggressive swapping   Useful commands:\n# Check the current value sysctl vm.swappiness # Adjust the value echo 10 \u0026gt; /proc/sys/vm/swappiness sysctl -w vm.swappiness=10 echo \u0026#34;vm.swappiness = 10\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/sysctl.conf   On SSDs, swapping out anonymous pages and reclaiming file pages are essentially equivalent in terms of performance/latency. On older spinning disks, swap reads are slower due to random reads, so a lower vm.swappiness setting makes sense there.\n  3.3. Using swap as emergency memory #   Swap is not generally about getting emergency memory, it\u0026rsquo;s about making memory reclamation egalitarian and efficient. In fact, using it as \u0026ldquo;emergency memory\u0026rdquo; is generally actively harmful.  4.

Features #   a multi-dimensional data model with time series data identified by metric name \u0026amp; key/value pairs PromQL, a flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality no reliance on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous time series collection happens via a pull model over HTTP pushing time series is supported via an intermediary gateway targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration multiple modes of graphing \u0026amp; dashboarding support  1.2. Architecture \u0026amp; components #  Prometheus scrapes metrics from instrumented jobs, either directly or via an intermediary push gateway for short-lived jobs. It stores all scraped samples locally \u0026amp; runs rules over this data to either aggregate \u0026amp; record new time series from existing data or generate alerts. Grafana or other API consumers can be used to visualize the collected data.\n Prometheus server: scrapes \u0026amp; stores time series data. Prometheus alertmanager: handle alerts. Special-purpose exporters. Push-gateway: support short-lived jobs. client libraries: instrument application code. Various support tools: Grafana,\u0026hellip;  2. Ansitheus #  2.1. Why Ansitheus? #  As you can see that, Prometheus ecosystem consists of multiple components. The operator may need a lot of efforts to configure, deploy \u0026amp; maintain these components. To make life easier, it is necessary to enter the world of automation, using modern tools of configuration management, provisioning \u0026amp; orchestration. Ansible is one of them. It is simple, agentless IT automation that anyone can use. My team decided to choose it as the automation solution, \u0026amp; Ansitheus is the result.\n2.2. Features #  The idea using Ansible to deploy Prometheus is not new. There are many existing solutions:\n cloudalchemy/ansible-prometheus ernestas-poskus/ansible-prometheus \u0026hellip;  So what makes Ansitheus be different with others?\n Deploy, configure \u0026amp; maintain the Prometheus ecosystem easily. Allow users to configure, deploy the system from scratch:  Prepare, configure the local repository. Install the necessary packages. Configure Docker private registry. Configure Docker daemon.   Containerize Prometheus components:  Docker is hotter than hot because it makes it possible to get far more apps running on the same old servers \u0026amp; it also makes it very easy to package \u0026amp; ship programs. You can easily find the advantages of Docker \u0026amp; container through internet.   High availability with HAProxy \u0026amp; Keepalived. Support centralized Docker logging with Fluentd. Support Ansible vault to work with sensitive data.  2.3.

You can easily find these such of knowledges in the references.\n 1. Context #  Etcd Version v3.4.0.\n2. Requirements #  2.1. Number of nodes #   \u0026gt;= 3 nodes. A etcd cluster needs a majority of nodes, a quorum to agree on updates to the cluster state. For a cluster with n-members, quorum is (n/2)+1.  2.2. CPUs #   Etcd doesn\u0026rsquo;t require a lot of CPU capacity. Typical clusters need 2-4 cores to run smoothly.  2.3. Memory #   Etcd performance depends on having enough memory (cache key-value data, tracking watchers\u0026hellip;). Typical 8GB is enough.  2.4. Disk #   An etcd cluster is very sensitive to disk latencies. Since etcd must persist proposals to its log, disk activity from other processes may cause long fsync latencies. The upshot is etcd may miss heartbeats, causing request timeouts and temporary leader loss. An etcd server can sometimes stably run alongside these processes when given a high disk priority. Check whether a disk is fast enough for etcd using fio. If the 99th percentile of fdatasync is \u0026lt;10ms, your storage is ok.  $ fio --rw=write --ioengine=sync --fdatasync=1 --directory=test-data \\  --size=22m --bs=2300 --name=mytest  SSD is recommended.  2.5. Network #   Etcd cluster should be deployed in a fast and reliable network. Low latency ensures etcd members can communicate fast. High bandwidth can reduce the time to recover a failed etcd member. 1GbE is sufficient for common etcd. Note that the network isn\u0026rsquo;t the only source of latency. Each request and response may be impacted by slow disks on both the leader and followers.  3. Tuning #  3.1. Time parameters #   Heartbeat interval.  The frequency with which the leader will notify followers that it is still the leader. Default: 100ms. Best practice: Around 0.5-1.5 x round-trip time (RTT) between members. Measure RTT with ping. Tradeoff: Too low -\u0026gt; etcd will send unnecessary messages -\u0026gt; increase the usage of CPU and network resources. Too high -\u0026gt; leads to high election timeout.   Election timeout.  How long a follower node will go without hearing a heartbeat before attempting to become leader itself. Default: 1000ms. Best practice: \u0026gt;= 10 x RTT and \u0026lt; 50s.   The heartbeat interval and election timeout value should be the same for all members in one cluster.  # Command line arguments: $ etcd --heartbeat-interval=100 --election-timeout=500 # Environment variables: $ ETCD_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=100 ETCD_ELECTION_TIMEOUT=500 etcd 3.2. Disk #   An etcd server can sometimes stably run alongside these processes when given a high disk priority using ionice.  # best effort, highest priority $ sudo ionice -c2 -n0 -p `pgrep etcd` 3.3. Snapshot #   etcd appends all key changes to a log file -\u0026gt; huge log that grows forever ☝️ Solution: Make periodic snapshots (save the current and remove old logs). Default: make snapshots after every 10 000 changes. Tuning: Just in case that etcd\u0026rsquo;s memory and disk usage is too high, lower threshold.  # Command line arguments: $ etcd --snapshot-count=5000 # Environment variables: $ ETCD_SNAPSHOT_COUNT=5000 etcd 4. Maintenance #  4.1. History compaction #   Etcd keeps an exact history of its keyspace, the history should be periodically compacted to avoid performance degradation and eventual storage space exhaustion. Etcd can be set to automatically compact the keyspace with the --auto-compaction-* option with a period of hours.  # keep one hour of history $ etcd --auto-compaction-retention=1 --auto-compaction-mode=periodic  Compaction modes:  Revision-based: --auto-compaction-mode=revision --auto-compaction-retention=1000 automatically Compact on \u0026ldquo;latest revision\u0026rdquo; - 1000 every 5-minute (when latest revision is 30000, compact on revision 29000). Use this when having a large keyspace. Periodic: --auto-compaction-mode=periodic --auto-compaction-retention=72h automatically Compact with 72-hour retention window every 1-hour. Use this when having a huge number of revisions for a key-value pair.    4.2. Defragmentation #   Compacting old revisions internally fragments etcd by leaving gaps in backend database - internal fragmentation. Internal fragmentation space is available for use by etcd but unavailable to the host filesystem. Solution: Release this space back to the filesystem with defrag.  $ etcdctl defrag  It should be run rather infrequently, as there is always going to be an unavoidable pause.  5.

The new version is coming soon, check its repository for status.\n This guide describes how to automatically scale out your Compute instances in response to heavy system usage. By combining with Prometheus pre-defined rules that consider factors such as CPU or memory usage, you can configure OpenStack Orchestration (Heat) to add and remove additional instances automatically, when they are needed.\n1. The standard OpenStack Autoscaling approach #  Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the standard OpenStack Autoscaling approach before goes to the new approach.\n1.1. Main components #    Orchestration: The core component providing automatic scaling is Orchestration (heat). Orchestration allows you to define rules using human-readable YAML templates. These rules are applied to evaluate system load based on Telemetry data to find out whether there is need to more instances into the stack. Once the load has dropped, Orchestration can automatically remove the unused instances again.\n  Telemetry: Telemetry does performance monitoring of your OpenStack environment, collecting data on CPU, storage and memory utilization for instances and physical hosts. Orchestration templates examine Telemetry data to access whether any pre-defined action should start.\n Ceilometer: a data collection service that provides the ability to normalise and transform data across all current OpenStack core components with work underway to support future OpenStack components. Gnocchi: provides a time-series resource indexing, metric storage service with enables users to capture OpenStack resources and the metrics associated with them. Aodh: enables the abiltity to trigger actions based on defined rules against sample or event data collected by Ceilometer.    1.2. Autoscaling process #  For more details, you could check IBM help documentation\n1.3. Drawbacks #   Ceilometer, Aodh are lacking of contribution. Ceilometer API was deprecated. Either Transform and pipeline was the same state, it means cpu_util will be unusable soon. In the commit message, @sileht - Ceilometer Core reviewer wrote that \u0026ldquo;Also backend like Gnocchi offers a better alternative to compute them\u0026rdquo;. But Aodh still deprecated Gnocchi aggregation API which doesn\u0026rsquo;t support rate:mean. For more details, you can follow the issue I\u0026rsquo;ve opened before. Be honest, I was gave up on it - 3 projects which was tightly related together, one change might cause a sequence and break the whole stack, how can I handle that? Aodh has its own formula to define rule based on Ceilometer metrics (that were stored in Gnocchi). But it isn\u0026rsquo;t correct sometimes cause the wrong scaling action. In reality, I face the case that Rabbitmq was under heavy load due to Ceilometer workload. IMO, Gnocchi documentation is not good enough. It might be a bias personal opinion.  2. The new approach with Faythe #  2.1. The idea #  Actually, this isn\u0026rsquo;t a complete new approach, it still leverages Orchestration (heat) to do scaling action. The different comes from Monitor service.\nTake a look at Rico Lin - Heat\u0026rsquo;s PTL, autoscale slide, basically, Autoscaling is the combination of 3 steps:\n Metering. Alarm. Scale.  OpenStack Telemetry takes care of Metering and Alarm. Ok, the new approach is simply using another service that can take Telemetry roles.\nThe another service is Prometheus stack. The question here is why I chose this?\n Nice query language: Prometheus provides a functional query language called PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) that lets the user select and aggregate time series data in real time. A wide range of exporter: The more exporter the more metrics I can collect and evaluate. Flexibile: Beside the system factor like CPU/Memory usage, I can evaluate any metrics I can collect, for example: JVM metrics. // Take time to investigate about Prometheus and fill it here by yourself  2.2.
